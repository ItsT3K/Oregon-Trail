# Oregon-Trail
A ASCII Terminal Port of The Oregon Trail programmed in C++
# Why on earth does this exist?
I liked The Oregon Trail when I was a kid *(albeit it was the Windows 9x MECC version)* and when I found the original BASIC versions code on-line I decided to port it to other things. Originally I attempted to port it to CBM BASIC (Commodore 64) but I failed miserably. Now that I'm learning more C/C++ I got into wanting to port this to POSIX Terminals. 
# Building it
Building it currently is easy. Right now there is no Makefile so all you need to do is run
`$ g++ oregon.cpp -o oregon`
